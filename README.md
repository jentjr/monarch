# monarch

R shiny app based on the desktop decision support tools to help in conservation planning for the imperiled monarch butterfly (Developed in support of the USGS' Monarch Conservation Science Partnership by Jason Rohweder and Wayne Thogmartin): These tools, developed using the python scripting library with ESRI ArcGIS software version 10.3, include a 'County Ranking Tool' which can be used for national, regional, or local prioritization of conservation activity; a 'Milkweed Calculator' to tabulate the amount of current and expected milkweed in a particular area of interest, and; a 'County Area Adjustment Tool' which can tabulate consequences of land change (a tool which has utility well beyond monarchs and the resources that sustain them). These tools and an associated user's manual are available at: http://www.umesc.usgs.gov/management/dss/monarch/desktop_monarch_conservation_planning_tools.html
